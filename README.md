Book Recommendation System
🔍 Project Type: Unsupervised
👤 Contribution: Individual
🧠 Domain: Recommendation Systems, Machine Learning
📄 Project Summary
With the explosion of online platforms like YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, recommender systems have become a critical component of the user experience. This project aims to build a Book Recommendation System that provides personalized book suggestions based on user reading behavior and preferences.

The system uses Collaborative Filtering and Cosine Similarity to recommend books to users with similar tastes. Active users and highly-rated books are filtered to improve accuracy and ensure relevant suggestions.

✅ Key Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning of Books, Users, and Ratings datasets

Filtering users with 50+ reviews and books with 250+ ratings

Creation of a User-Item Interaction Matrix

Use of Cosine Similarity to find similar users and generate recommendations

Focus on quality filtering to avoid popularity bias

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Sklearn

Cosine Similarity

Collaborative Filtering

Matplotlib, Seaborn (if visualization was used)

📊 Results
Successfully delivered book recommendations with high relevance for active users

Demonstrated effective filtering and recommendation logic using similarity-based scoring

Enabled personalized content discovery, improving user satisfaction and engagement

Book Recommendation System – Capstone Project
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, Cosine Similarity, Collaborative Filtering

Objective: Developed a collaborative filtering-based recommendation engine to suggest personalized books to users based on their reading behavior and rating history.

Cleaned and merged Books, Users, and Ratings datasets; created a user-item interaction matrix for similarity computation.

Filtered active users (50+ reviews) and popular books (250+ ratings) to improve model performance and relevance.

Applied cosine similarity to detect users with similar preferences and recommend highly-rated books accordingly.

Result: Delivered relevant and diverse book suggestions, enhancing user engagement by aligning recommendations with reader interests.
